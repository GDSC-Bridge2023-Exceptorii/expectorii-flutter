## 💭 Problem
Economic inequality in the last few decades have become a big problem all over the world. This might be caused because of the importance of technological literacy - those who can not use it have many problems in the world, especially during Covid. Specifically, Japan and Korea has a lot of adults and seniors that want to join in the digital economy - upskill themselves. However, there is a lack of resources to help them bootstrap. 


## 🔍 About Eldy
<b>Empowering Older Adults: Improving Senior Digital Literacy</b>
<p>Our team's goal is to make everyone enjoy an easy and convenient digital world, not a difficult and complex digital world. 'Eldy' gives customized digital education services for the elderly to address digital gaps and inequalities. The characteristics of this service are simple buttons and intuitive screens aimed at the elderly, and access to and use of practical information such as search methods. Also, 'Eldy' provides a service to distinguish fake news through the ml model. When the camera takes a picture of text, the server side parses it through the ml model and returns the output. </p>


## 🎯 Our SDGs Goals
<b>To reduce inequality</b> (Specifically, inequality between those with good grasp of tech and those without)
